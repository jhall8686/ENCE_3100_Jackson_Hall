# Lab 5

The purpose of this lab was to walk through addition, subtraction, and multiplication using various techniques.

### Part 1 - Accumulator

The accumulator circuit, as seen below, adds the inputted number to the final total, thus "accumulating" the total.

To implement this in Verilog, four modules need to be instantiatedâ€” three of them can be instantiated with an n-bit register module, pictured below:

The last module is a simple ALU, which can be designed in one line. Therefore, the full accumulator module looks like this:

Implementing the accumulator in the top module:

This takes the output and converts it into a 2-digit BCD number to be displayed with the 7-segment displays. When uploaded to the DE10, it behaves as expected:

### Part 2 - Accumulator/Subtractor

This circuit is largely the same as in Part 1, but includes an input subtract bit, which determines whether input A get subtracted from the final sum or added to it. the accumulator circuit changes as follows:

The only line that changes is the ALU line, which has been swapped for a ternary statement that instead performs subtraction if the subtract bit is 1. Implementing this in the top module:

And synthesizing on the DE10:

### Part 3 - Multiplication with Full Adders

Multiplication by hand is done by adding shifted summands, and in digital logic, it is done much in the same way.
