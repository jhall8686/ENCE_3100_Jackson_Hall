# Lab 8- Very Simple Microprocessor

All of the components required for a basic microprocessor have been covered now in this course, so this lab attempts to combine them all into a simple microprocessor that can read, interpret, and execute assembly instructions in the form of 8-bit binary numbers.

This circuit outlines each important subsystem of the microprocessor; each individual circuit will be covered in the following sections.

## Accumulator A and B

The accumulators are simply registers that will be fed into the ALU. They differ slightly because of Accumulator A's capability to output its contents to the central bus.
